Can guesstimate # of cores from desktop vs mobile: 4 vs 2, say, and multiply by 1.3*(year-2014).

Arguments for API:
 - propose a new API: navigator.approximateNumberOfCores() that is just a guess, as above,
   or something better, like an internal measurement plus a fudge factor (could be dynamic too)
 - demonstrate (or not) that using this number on a range of benchmarks does (or does not)
   give results that are about as good as when using the actual number of cores
